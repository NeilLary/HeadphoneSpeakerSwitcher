# HeadphoneSpeakerSwitcher
An interactive Rainmeter skin for your desktop to switch audio

HeadphoneSpeakerSwitcher allows you to switch between the speaker and headphone audio by setting the default device and default communication device

Pre-requisites:
Installing Rainmeter: https://www.rainmeter.net/
Installing skins: https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/installing-skins/

Set the Rainmeter to run on startup and load the skin to the Rainmeter and you are ready to go.
During the startup, the AudioSwitcher runs by default and sets the speaker as Default Device and Default Communication Device. During switching between headphones/speaker, the Default Device and Default Communication Device would be set for the selected device.

This fixes the issue in VOIP applications where even though the you've selected your preferred device through the windows, still the VoIP audio pass through the Default Communication Device.
